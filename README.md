Your project reduces server busy time using AI. It helps manage high traffic situations (like when many students check results at the same time) by:
Predicting high traffic using AI.
Redirecting requests to free servers.
Blocking unnecessary requests (e.g., spam/bots).
Scaling resources automatically to handle extra load.
